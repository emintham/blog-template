# Blog Template
Kinfolk inspired blog template using [Astro](https://astro.build/).

# Instructions
1. Check for `TODO`s in the code and change them. [Ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) or regular `grep` may be helpful here.
2. Change `Your Name` and `Your Blog` in code. [Fastmod](https://github.com/facebookincubator/fastmod) may be helpful here.
3. Delete sample posts.
4. Check out locally using `pnpm dev --host`. Omit host if just testing locally.
